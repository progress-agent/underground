# UnderGround station/platform depth anchors
#
# Goal: provide Z anchors for a depth-aware network model.
#
# Notes:
# - There is no single open official dataset with platform depths for the entire Underground.
# - This table is intended to be curated over time with citations.
# - depth_m is "metres below ground" (positive number). If unknown, leave blank.
# - Prefer NaPTAN station ids (TfL uses these as naptanId for Tube stations, e.g. 940GZZLUOXC).
#
# Coverage:
# - Victoria line: complete (16 stations)
# - Bakerloo line: partial (in progress)
# - Central line: partial (in progress)
# - Jubilee, Northern, Piccadilly: TODO (research from Wikipedia/TfL archives)
